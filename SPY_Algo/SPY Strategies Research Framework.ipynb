    "The development of systematic trading strategies often begins with a foundational question: where, in the vast and interconnected global markets, can a persistent, exploitable edge be found? This question becomes particularly acute when the target instrument is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), arguably one of the most liquid, transparent, and efficient financial instrument in the world. The very characteristics that make SPY an ideal vehicle for passive investment and market exposure - its high trading volume, tight bid-ask spreads, and direct tracking of a major benchmark - also suggest that any informational inefficiencies should be arbitraged away almost instantaneously. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), in its semi-strong form, posits that all publicly avaliable information is already reflected in an asset's price, making it impossible to consistently generate excess returns."

    "However, the premise of this report is that while the market for SPY may approach perfect efficiency over longer time horizons, it is subject to short-term, transient inefficiencies. These temporary dislocation from a short-term equilibrium are not necessarily failures of the market. This report establishes a rigorous, reproducible, and extensible framework for identifying, implementing, and validating a trading strategy designed to systematically profit from these inefficiencies. The initial focus is constrained to an \"intra-ETF\", market-neutral approach on the SPY ETF using daily historical data, with the explicit goal of building a process that is as valuable as the strategy it produces."

    "The theoretical foundation for short-term inefficiencies in highly liquid markets is largely rooted in the field of behavioral finance, which proposes that psychological influences and biases systematically affect the financial behaviors of investors. These predictable patterns of irrationality, when aggregated across millions of market participants, can create temporary mispricings even in an instrument as widely followed as SPY."

    "A primary driver of these mispricings is the tendency for investors to overreact to recent news, price movements, or salient events. This behavior stems from several well-documented cognitive biases. The availability heuristic, for instance, leads individuals to overweight information that is easily recalled, such as dramatic recent price drops or surges. This is compounded by overconfidence, where investors overestimate their ability to interpret information predict future outcomes, leading to excessively large trades based on recent trends. When a stock or index experiences a sharp move, these biases can trigger a cascade of similar actions, a phenomenon known as herd behavior. Investors mimic the action of the majority, amplifying the initial price swing and pushing the asset's price beyond a level justified by its fundamentals. this collective overestension creates the conditions for a subsequent correction, or mean reversion, as the initial emotional reaction subsides and a more rational assessment of value prevails. A market-neutral mean-reversion strategy is designed to systematically capitalise on this cycle of overreaction and correction by taking positions contrary to the prevailing short-term momentum."

    "The very structure of the SPY ETF, designed for maximum liquidity, paradoxically contributes to these behavioral-driven price patterns. Because SPY is one of the most actively traded securities globally, it serves as the primary vehicle for a vast ecosystem of traders to express short-term market views, implement hedges, and react to macroeconomic news. This constant flow of orders, driven by a heterogeneous mix of participants with varying objectives and time horizons - from long-term institutional investors to high-frequency arbitrageurs - introduces a significant amount of \"non-fundamental\" volatility into the price series. The high liquidity that suggests market efficiency is, therefore, also a primary source of the noise and temporary dislocations from which a mean-reversion strategy seeks to profit. The strategy, ineffect, acts as a liquidity provider, absorbing the temporary supply/demand imbalances created by more reactive market participants (or aggresive algos) and profiting from the eventual stabilisation of the price."

    "Beyond purely behavioral factors, structural elements of the ETF market itself can contribute to predictable price patterns. The primary mechanism ensuring an ETF's price stays aligned with its underlying Net Asset Value (NAV) is the creation/redemption process, managed by Authorised Participants (APs). When an ETF's market price deviates significantly from its NAV, APs have an incentive to perform arbitrage by creating or redeeming large blocks of ETF shares in exchange for the underlying basket of securities, a process that pushes the market price back toward the NAV. However, this arbitrage is not frictionless; it involves transactional cost, operational complexities, and risk. Consequently, the ETF price can fluctuate within a narrow \"arbitrage band\" around its NSV without triggering a corrective action from SPs. The oscillations within this band can present opportunities for systematic trading strategies."

    "Furthermore, while the initial scope of this report is limited to daily data, it is important to acknowledge the well-documented existence of intraday patterns in trading activity. Market microstructure studies have consistently identified patterns in volume, volatility, and bid-ask spreads, such as the characteristic \"J-shaped\" or \"U-shaped\" curve where spreads are widest at the market open and close and narrowest during midday. These patterns, driven by the strategic behavior of informed and uninformed traders throughout the trading day, represent another class of structural inefficiency. A strategy successfully developed on daily data can often be adapted to a higher frequency to exploit these intraday regularities, providing a clear and logical path for future research and strategy enhancement."

    "Hypothesis 1: Volatility-Normalised Mean Reversion (Behavioral Overreaction)\n",
    "- Rationale: This strategy is founded on the behavioral premise of investor overreaction. It seeks to identify statistically significant, short-term price extensions and systematically bet on their reversion to a recent mean. The core mechanism involves using technical oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or statistical measures like Z-scores to quantify when SPY is \"overbought\" or \"oversold\" relative to iyts recent history. A signal is generated to short the ETF in overbought conditions and buy it in oversold conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Feature: The critical innovation of this approach is the \" volatility-normalised\" compoenent. Static thresholds (e.g., \"sell when RSI > 70\") are notoriously unreliable because the behavior of both price and indicators changes with market volatility. This strategy adapts to the prevailing market regime by using a measure of recent volatility, such as the Average True Range (ATR), to dynamically adjust its entry triggers, exit points, position sizes. For example, a entry signal might require not only an extreme RSI reading but also a price move exceeding a certain multiple of the ATR, filtering out minor flucuations and focusing on genuine, high-conviction overextensions. This adaptability is designed to make the strategy more robust across different market conditions."

    "Hypothesis 2: Statistical Arbitrage via ETF Component Replication (Structual Arbitrage)\n",
    "- Rationale: This strategy targets potential structural inefficiencies in the ETF arbitrage mechanism itself. It operates on the principle that the \"true\" value of the SPY ETF at any moment is the weighted sum of the real-time prices of its 500 underlying constituent stocks. By independently calculating this synthetic NAV and comparing it to the traded market price of SPY, a small, transient spread can often be identified, The strategy would involve trading this spread: buying SPY and shorting the basket of constituents when SPY trades at a discount to its synthetic NAV, and vice versa when it trades at a premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenges: While theoretically powerful, this approach presents significantly practical hurdles for the initial scope of this project, It is not truly \"intra-ETF\", as it necessitates the acquisition, cleaning, and real-time processing of data for 501 different securities. Furthermore, a realistic backtest would require a complex transaction cost model that accounts for the costs of trading large basket of potentially less-liquid stocks, which can be substantial. These data and implementation complexities make it a more suitable candidate for a follow-on project after the core framework has been established."

    "Hypothesis 3: Sentiment & Flow Analysis via Options Market Data (Information Asymmetry)\n",
    "- Rationale: The options market for SPY is one of the most liquid and active in the world, serving as a major venue for speculation and hedging. The aggregate activity in this market can provide powerful leading indicators of sentiment and potential future price movements in the underlying ETF. This strategy would derive its signals from options-based data, such as the Put-call Ratio (PCR), which measures the volume of puts traded relative to calls. An extremely high PCR can indicate widespread fear and capitulation, often preceding a market bottom and a subsequent price rebound. Other potential signal include significant changes in Open Interest (OI) at key strike prices, which can indicate institutional positioning, and shifts in the term structure of Implied Volatility (IV), which can signal changing expectations of future risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenges: The primary obstacle for this strategy is data accessibility. Comprehensive historical options data, including intraday quotes and volumes across all strikes and expirations, is rarely available for free and can be expensive to license. Managing and processing this high-dimensional data (price, time, strike, expiration) also adds a significant layer of complexity, moving it beyond the project's initial goal of utilising simple, freely available data sources."

    "- Volatility Normalisation: The ATR will be used to create dynamic, adaptive threshold for trade entry. Rather than relying on a static price change, an entry signal will be conditioned on a price move that is significant relative to the recent volatility. For instance, a long entry might require the RSI to be below 30 and for the closing price to be below the previous day's low by a factor of the ATR. This helps the strategy distinguish between genuine market overextensions and low-volatility noise, thereby improving signal quality.\n",

Historical analysis shows that mean-reversion strategies tend to perform poorly during periods of extreme market panic, when momentum and cascading liquidations dominate price action. Therefore, the strategy will be programmed to be \"flat\" - holding no positions and generating no new signals - whenever the VIX closes above a predefined threshold, such as 40.

    "The statistics in this table reveal critical properties of the market data. The negative skew and high kurtosis (fat tails) of SPY's daily returns confirm that extreme negative events are more common than a normal distribution would suggest, underscoring the necessity of robust risk management. The distribution of the RSI indicator helps in setting reasonable initial thresholds for overbough/oversold levels. For instance, knowing the historical range allows for the slection of entry points that correspond to statistically rare events. Finally, the distribution of the VIX provides an empirical basis for setting the regime filter threshold; a value of 40, for example, would represent an event more than two standard deviations above the mean, clearly delineating a state of extreme market stress."

    "The foundational logic of the backtesting engine will be rebuilt to incorporate professional-grade standard for performance calculation and portfolio tracking.\n",
    "- Vectorised Performance Calculation: The original engine calculates the equity curve using an iterative loop over a list of closed trades. This approach is computationally inefficient and becomes prohitbitively slow with a large number of trades or when running complec optimisations. The engine will be re-engineered to use a vectorised approach. This involves generating a daily time series of target positions (e.g., +1 for long, -1 for short, 0 for flat) and a daily time series of returns. The strategy's daily P&L can then be calculated with a single vectorised operation in pandas (e.g., positions.shift(1) * returns), which is orders of magnitude faster and more scalable.\n",
    "- Daily Mark-to-Market Accounting: A critical flaw in the initial scaffold is that it only updates portfolio equity when a trade is closed. A professional backtesting system must \"mark-to-market\" the portfolio at the end of each trading day. This means calculating the value of all open positions based on the daily closing price and reflecting the unrealised gains or losses in the daily equity curve. This provides a true continous measure of portfolio value and is essential for the accurate calculation of key risk metrics like volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown, which depends on a daily time series of returns.\n",
    "- Integration of empyrical for Standardised Metrics: To ensure a comprehensive and standardised evaluation of strategy performance, the empyrical library will be integrated into the backtesting framework. After a backtest is complete, the resulting daily returns series will be passed to empyrical functions to generate a full performance \"tear sheet\". This will include metrics such as Annualised Return, Annual Volatility, Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return), Sortino Ratio (downside risk-adjusted return), Calmar Ratio (return relative to drawdown), and Maximum Drawdown. Using a standardised library ensures consistency and comparability across different strategy variations."

    "Realistic simulation of transaction costs is non-negotiable for validing a short-term strategy, where small profits can be easily eroded by excecution frictions. A multi-faceted cost model will be implemented to reflect the realities of trading a highly liquid ETF like SPY.\n",
    "- Bid-Ask Spread: While SPY boasts one of the tightest bid-ask spreads in the market, it is not zero. The median 30-day spread for SPY is consistently low, often around 0.01%. This cost will be modelled by assuming that every buy order executes at the ask price and every sell order executes at the bid price. For simulation purposes, this can be implemented bu subtracting half the spread from the execution price on a sell and adding half the spread on a buy.\n",
    "- Commissions: While many retail brokers now advertise \"zero-commission\" trading, this often masks costs in the form of poorer execution quality (payment for order flow). To maintain a conservative and realistic estimate, a small per-share commission will be modelled, based on typical institutional or sophisticated retail pricing, such as $0.0035 per share.\n",
    "- Slippage: Slaippage representthe price difference between where a trade is intended to be executed and where it is actually filled. For a daily-frequency strategy, this can be modelled as a small, unfavourable price movement that occurs as a result of our order. The slippage cost will be modelled as a small fraction of the day's trading range (High - Low), applied against the trade's execution price.\n",
    "- Borrow Costs: A market-neutral strategy requires taking short positions. Shorting an ETF involves borrowing the shares, which incurs a fee. For a highly liquid and readily available ETF like SPY, this cost is typically low but must be included for completeness. It will be modelled as a small annualised interest rate (e.g., 0.25% per yeaar) applied to the market value of any open short positions, accrued on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of a realistic cost model is not merely an accounting exercise; it can fundamentally alter the viability of a strategy. The bid-ask spread, in particular, is not a static number. It is known to widen dramatically during periods of high market volatility and stress. A mean-reversion strategy, which inherently thrives on volatility to generate signals, may find that its theoretical edge is completely consumed by these transaction costs precisely when it is most active. this dynamic relationship means that market volatility, as measured by the VIX or ATR, serves a dual purpose. It is not only a filter for identifying valid trading signals but also a proxy for the tradability of those signals. A high-VIX environment may generate numerous apparent overextensions, but the associated increase in execution costs could render them unprofitable. Therefore, the backtesting engine will incorporate a dynamic spread model, where the simulated bid-ask spread is a function of the daily VIX level. This creates a more robust simulation and provides a strong economic rationale for using a VIX-based regime filter - it helps the strategy avoid trading when the cost of the execution is likely to overwhelm the potential profit."

Based on this analysis, the parameter set of {RSI Entry: 25, ATR Multiplier: 1.0} would be selected for the subsequent out-of-sample and walk-forward validation stages."

Conversely, there is also a 5% it could be as high as 1.10. Critically, the 5th percentile for both Annualised Return and Sharpe Ratio is comfortably positive, providing strong statistical evidence that the strategy's positive performance is not simply due to random chance. The drawdown analysis also provides a more realistic expectation of risk; while the historical path experienced a -12.1% drawdown, the simulation shows that a drawdown as deep as -18.5% is a plausible outcome that a trader must be prepared to endure."

    "Different position sizing models operate on different principles, leading to vastly different portfolio dynamics. Three primary models will be considered:\n",
    "- Fixed Fractional Sizing: This is one of the simplest and most common method. It involves risking a fixed fraction or percentage of the total account equity on each trade. For example, trader might decide to risk 1% of their captial on any given position. The number of shares to trade is then calculated based on the distance to the initial stop-loss. While robust and effective at preventing catastrophic losse, this method is not adpative to the specific characteristics of each trade signal.\n",
    "- Kelly Criterion: Developed for information theory, the Kelly Criterion provides a mathematical formula for the optimal position size that maximises the long-term geometric growth rate of capital. the formula is f* = (bp - q)/b, where p is the probability of winning, q is the probability of losing (1-p), and b is the win/loss ratio (average gain / average loss). While theoretically optimal, the full Kelly fraction is notoriously aggresive and can lead to extreme portfolio volatility and deep drawdowns. It is also highly sensitive to the accuracy of its inputs, which must be estimated from historical data and may not hold in the future. A more common and conservative application is \"Fractional Kelly\" (e.g., Hlaf-Kelly), which uses a fraction of the calculated optimal size.\n",
    "- Volatility Parity (inverse volatility Sizing): This approach aims to equalise the risk contribution of each trade to total portfolio risk. This position size is set to be inversely proportional to the volatility of the asset at the time of the trade. For a single-asset strategy, this means taking smaller positions when the asset is highly volatile and larger position when it is calm. this method is highly synergistic with a volatility-sensitive strategy, as it naturally reduces exposure during the high-risk periods that often accompany mean-reversion signals."

    "Given the strategy's focus on adapting to market volatility, the Volatility Parity model is the most logical and theoretically consistent choice. It will be implemented as follows:\n",

    "2. Measure Volatility: At the time of a trade signal, the current value of the 14-day ATR is used as the measure of volatility.\n",
    "3. Calculate Position Size: The dollar amount to be invested in the position is calculated as: Position Size ($) = Target Risk ($) / (ATR (points) / Price) - This formula sizes the position such that a price move of one ATR corresponds to the target dollar risk.

    "2. reconcile_position(): This is the main execution function, designed to be run periodically (e.g., once per day after market close). Its logic is as follows:\n",
    "   - Connect to API: It initialises the Alpaca REST client using the APU keys stored as environment variables (APCA_API_KEY_ID, APCA_API_SECRET_KEY) and sets the base URL to the paper trading endpoint (https://paper-api.alpaca.markets).\n",
    "   - Fetch Current State: It queries the API to get the current position in SPY using api.get_position('SPY'). This returns a Position object detailing the quantity of shares held (positive for long, negative for short) or raises an exception if no position exists. The current position is translated into an integer state (e.g., +1, -1, 0).\n",
    "   - Determine Target State: It fetches the latest market data and calls generate_live_signal() to determine the desired target position.\n",
    "   - Execute Orders: It compares the current position to the target position. If they are the same, no action is taken. If they differ, it submits the neccessary market order to reconsile the portfolio. For example, if the current position is long (+1) and the target is is flat (0), it submits a sell order for the entire quantity of the current position using api.submit_order(symbol='SPY', qty=current_qty, side='sell', ...). If the current position is flat (0) and the target is short (-1), it first calculates the required number of shares based on the Volatility Parity sizing model and then submits a sell (short) for that quantity."

    "A successful backtest does not guarantee successful live trading. A host of operational risks exist that are not captured in a historical simulation. These include:\n",
    "- Data Feed Integrity: The live data feed from the broker or a third-party provider may contain errors, gaps, or be delayed, causing the algorithm to make decisions based on faulty information.\n",
    "- API and Connectivity Issues: The connection to the broker's API can fail, or the API itself may experience downtime, preventing the algorithm from placing or managing orders.\n",
    "- Execution Uncertainty: In a live environment, order fulls are not guaranteed at the last-traded price. Market orders can experience significant slippage, especially during volatile periods.\n",
    "- System Failures: The machine running the algorithm could crash, lose power, or lose internet connectivity, leaving open positions unmanaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these risks, a production-grade system requires robust infrastructure, including comprehensive logging of all action and decisions, an automated alerting system to notify the operator of any errors or unexpected behavior, and a clear \"kill switch\" protocol to immediately flatten all positions and halt the algorithm in case of a critical failure."

    "The core hypothesis - that behavioral overreactions in the highly liquid SPY ETF create predictable, short-term mean-reversion opportunities - was found to be viable when approached with a sophisticated, adaptive model. The key findings are:\n",
    "1. Adaptability is Crucial: A simple, static mean-reversion strategy is insufficient. The integration of a volatility-normalisation component (using ATR) and a market-regime filter (using the VIX) was essential for navigating different market conditions and improving signal quality.\n",
    "2. Rigorous Validation is Non-Negotiable: The strategy demonstrated positive performance not only in-sample but also in out-of-sample testing. More importantly, the walk-forward analysis showed that the strategy's edge was persistent across different time periods, and the Monte Carlo simulations provided statistical confidence that the positive results were unlikely to be a product of random chance.\n",
    "3. Risk Management Drives Performance: The choice of position sizing model had a profound impact on the strategy's risk-adjusted returns. The Volatility Parity approach, which aligns position size with the strategy's core logic of adapting to volatility, was empirically shown to produce the superior risk-adjusted outcome, yielding the highest Sharpe and Calmar ratios while effectively containing drawdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final, integrated strategy represents a statistically robust model for extracting alpha from short-term inefficiencies in the SPY ETF. The confidence intervals derived from the bootstrap analysis suggest a geniune albeit modest, adge after accounting for realistic transactional costs."

    "The framework developed in this report is not an endpoint but a foundation. the value of a systematic process lies in its capacity for iterative improvement. Several high-potential avenues for future researcj are immediately apparent:\n",
    "1. Scaling to Intraday Data: The most direct extension of this work is to apply the same volatility-normalised mean-reversion principles to a higher data frequency, such as 5-minute or 15-minute bars. This would allow the strategy to capture a greater number of smaller-scale inefficiences and exploit the known intraday patterns in market microstrcuture.\n",
    "2. Developing Alternative Hypotheses: The two other strategies proposed in Section II - Statistical Arbitrage on ETF components and Options-Based Sentiment Analysis - remain compelling but more complex avenues for research. With the core backtesting and risk management framework now in place, these data-intensive strategies become more tractable projects.\n",
    "3. Machine Learning Enhancements: The current strategy relies on a static, rule-based logic for signal generation (e.g., IF RSI < 25 AND...). A powerful next step would be to replace this logic with a machine learning model, such as a Gradient Boosting classifier. The engineered features (RSI, ATR, Z-score, VIX) would serve as inputs to the model, which would be trained to predict the probability of a positve or negative return on the next day. This could capture more complex, non-linear interactions between the features and potentially lead to a more accurate and adaptive signal.\n",
    "4. Portfolio Application and Diversification: The single-asset framework can be expanded to a portfolio of highly liquid, correlated ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ for the Nasdaq-100, and IWM for the Russel 2000). This would enable the developement of pairs trading strategies that trade the relative value between these indices, or sector rotation strategies that apply momentum and mean-reversion principles across different sectors of the economy. This would introduce the benefits of diversification and potentially create a more stable, multi-alpha source of returns."
